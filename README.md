# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

## My process

Since, this page/site includes minimal JavaScript code, I decided to use vanilla JS. JS is used for nav options toggling and scroll effects. 

I used *Tailwind CSS* without any preprocessors to style this page. The commit history indicates my process.
